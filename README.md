This repository allows you (if it is supported by your IDE) to simply include Qt header file by Qt type name.
Add `_qt_headers` to C++ include search path and then type:

  #include <qt/Q
  
And then your IDE will suggest a suitable types for you.

All you need to configure your IDE is to add `$(YourHeadersRoot)/_qt_headers` to your IDE `Include Path`.
